# DH-110-assignmnt-05-low-fidelity-prototyping

Stacey Amery Dela Serna

## Brief Project Description
Brief Project Description: I felt inspired by the zero hunger project to improve the student needs and resources from my alma mater community college, College of the Desert. In this way, I hope that the features I created inform more people of the nutritional food that is available to them at a free cost! 

## Purpose of Low Fidelity Prototypes

To focus on the function of the webpage and if it actually serves the audience it was intended for. At this stage, the design process (like the information architecture) is forming but it is still highly editable which allows for more improvement in the next iterations after a user tests it. 

## User Research 
 Evidence to support for these features was based on the personas and user scenarios which were based on the hour long contextual inquiry.

Questions: 
* How can we make the food pantry schedules more visible to College of the Desert students? 
* How can we cater to the people who are reluctant to go to a food pantry, but need those services? 
* How can we make the process of learning about these free resources quick, easy, and engaging through design? 

## Personas and Scenario
* A hardworking single mother who can easily find out if a food pantry event works into her schedule or not
* A first generation eldest son who loves his siblings, but he is too shy to go to to the food pantry and be seen by his family. 

## Tasks/Features 
1. Locating the nearest food closet with dates and times using a map

1.5 Featuring personal stories of many people who have been positively impacted by COD food pantry.  

2.  Updated inventory with a reservation system

## User Testing Comments
1. Locating the nearest food closet with dates and times using a map

> Adding dates and schedule to calendar from map. I noticed that this instruction was a little more convoluted than I thought it would be for the users. It made me think that it should be separate sections that are connected rather than trying to do both at the same time. Even though I meant to do a zoomed up version of the left side bar, I am not sure if it came across that way without me telling that it is so.

1.5 Featuring personal stories of many people who have been positively impacted by COD food pantry.  

> The second part of the task is the personal stories, but the user pointed out that there was not much testing to do. She instead gave suggestions to add like doing an optional submission link. 

2.  Updated inventory with a reservation system
> The second task was adding the maximum amount of items to reserve from the real time updated inventory of the food pantry. She pointed out that there should be a filter option at the top so that future users can utilize the tags. She also suggested adding a verification to the COD ID and Name input so that the system actually knows its the said student doing the business. 

## Reflection
The prototyping was more difficult than I thought, so I had to watch a few videos on YouTube for examples. However, I had a lot more fun when I got the hang of it. Prototyping was a lot more repetition, especially by hand. I’m glad I have the privilege of owning an iPad because it did reduce the strain on my hands. The user was a little lost on where to start because there were no labels or numbers for the screen, so I might include labels for organizational look rather than describing what’s on the prototype. I had to remind my user to walk through with what they were taking a few times. Testing was very insightful to the design process, and I will be sure to implement these features in later iterations.
