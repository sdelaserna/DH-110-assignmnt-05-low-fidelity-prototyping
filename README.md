Stacey Amery Dela Serna

## Brief Project Description
Brief Project Description: I felt inspired by the zero hunger project to improve the student needs and resources from my alma mater community college, College of the Desert. In this way, I hope that the features I created inform more people of the nutritional food that is available to them at a free cost! 

## Purpose of Low Fidelity Prototypes

To focus on the function of the webpage and if it actually serves the audience it was intended for. At this stage, the design process (like the information architecture) is forming but it is still highly editable which allows for more improvement in the next iterations after a user tests it. 

## User Research 
 Evidence to support for these features was based on the personas and user scenarios which were based on the hour long contextual inquiry.

Questions: 
* How can we make the food pantry schedules more visible to College of the Desert students? 
* How can we cater to the people who are reluctant to go to a food pantry, but need those services? 
* How can we make the process of learning about these free resources quick, easy, and engaging through design? 

## Personas and Scenario
* A hardworking single mother who can easily find out if a food pantry event works into her schedule or not
* A first generation eldest son who loves his siblings, but he is too shy to go to to the food pantry and be seen by his family. 

## Tasks/Features 
1. Locating the nearest food closet with dates and times using a map
2. Featuring personal stories of many people who have been positively impacted by COD food pantry. 
3. Updated inventory with a reservation system
